  - My Grammy is too sick to do chores around her hut, is there anything you can
    give me to help with that?
  - My butler has gone missing. I can't be bothered conducting any sort of investigation
    so I'd much rather replace him.
  - Recently I've been unable to keep on top of all my house hold tasks. The dishes
    haven't been washed for weeks.
