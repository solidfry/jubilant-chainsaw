  - I am inundated with scurrying little furry critters in my basement. I need help
    getting rid of them, but I can't speak rat!
  - My cow's won't leave their field and they are running out of food. Help!
  - I am sick of the birds waking me up in the morning... what can you give me to
    help? Maybe if I could convince them to leave...
