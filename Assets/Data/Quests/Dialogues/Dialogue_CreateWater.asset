  list:
  - The brook has gone dry and now my ducks have no where to swim. Their little flappy
    feet will dry out.
  - I am sick and tired of getting up early to bring water from the well. I need
    some rest. Can you help me with my problem?
  - A cow died in the river near my house, and I am unable to get water for my family.
    Are you able to help me?
